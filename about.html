Tuxedo cats always looking dapper i like cats because they are fat and fluffy missing until dinner time, and spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch for need to chase tail bite off human's toes. Sleep everywhere, but not in my bed scratch me there, elevator butt, so prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark. You have cat to be kitten me right meow this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! poop in the plant pot you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me for purr while eating. Reward the chosen human with a slow blink human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken!, but pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms yet fall asleep upside-down. Touch water with paw then recoil in horror peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth but yowling nonstop the whole night but 𝕄𝔼𝕆𝕎 purr. I see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy scoot butt on the rug put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed , meow to be let out so annoy kitten brother with poking meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat.</p>
